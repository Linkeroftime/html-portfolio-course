    <h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>1. Fight Club</h3>
    <p>It's a classic, and I love the twist at the end. Blew my mind when I watched it the first time.</p>
    <h3>2. Meet the Robinsons</h3> 
    <p>I loved watching this movie as a kid, along with Hercules, which I would argue would occupy the same spot</p>
    <h3>3. The Princess Bride</h3>
    <p>Also a classic, I could not believe the fact that I had never watched it before I did, just a year ago. I love Inigo Montoya.</p>
